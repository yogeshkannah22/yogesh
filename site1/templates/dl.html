        Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural networks. 
        It is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within data. 
        In deep learning, we don’t need to explicitly program everything. 
        It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the advances in processing power and the availability of large datasets. 
        Because it is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) also known as deep neural networks (DNNs). 
        These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s biological neurons, and they are designed to learn from large amounts of data.
